# 📈 Stock Market Trend Estimation — Numerical Methods Project

This project uses **forward**, **backward**, and **central finite difference methods** to estimate and predict stock prices for the next day based on data from the previous week.

---

## 🧠 Concept

Finite difference methods are basic numerical techniques used to approximate derivatives.  
In this context, we treat stock prices as a function of time and estimate the daily rate of change to project the next value.

- **Forward Difference** → Uses recent prices to estimate the upcoming change  
- **Backward Difference** → Uses past prices to verify consistency  
- **Central Difference** → Averages both for stability  

The final prediction is a **weighted combination** of all three.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Input: List of 7 daily stock prices (representing one week)
2. Compute:
   - Forward, backward, and central differences
   - Weighted average slope
   - Confidence based on variance of changes
3. Output:
   - Predicted price for the next day
   - Confidence percentage
   - Trend visualization (auto-generated and saved as PNG)

## 🖥️ Usage

### ▶️ Run the project

python stock_trend_predictor.py

## 🧪 Testing Steps
Follow the steps below to test and run the Stock Market Predictor project on your computer.

1. Prerequisites 💻 
- Before running the project, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher installed 👉 Download Python
- A stable internet connection (for downloading dependencies and fetching stock data)
- The project files downloaded and extracted from GitHub


### 2. macOS Setup 🍏 
- Open Terminal
Press Command + Space, type Terminal, and hit Enter.

- Navigate to the project folder
cd ~/Downloads/stock_market_predictor-main

- Upgrade pip (recommended)
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

- Install required libraries
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
If no requirements.txt file is available, install manually:
pip3 install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib yfinance

- Run the program
python3 stock_market_predictor.py


## Expected output 
The script should display or plot the stock trend prediction (e.g., graphs or prediction values.
If the project requires additional input data, follow on-screen prompts or check the README.md.

### 3. Windows Setup 🪟 
- Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
Press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.


- Navigate to the project folder
cd %HOMEPATH%\Downloads\stock_market_predictor-main


- Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip


- Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

Or manually:

- pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib yfinance
Run the program --> `python stock_market_predictor.py`

## Expected output
The program will analyze and/or visualize stock market trends. Verify there are no missing modules or file errors.


4. Troubleshooting 🧾

| ⚠️ Issue | 💡 Possible Cause | 🔧 Solution |
|---|---|---|
| ModuleNotFoundError | Missing dependency | Run: pip install <module_name> |
| Permission denied | You don’t have access rights to the folder | Windows: Run Command Prompt as Administrator <br/> Mac: Move project to your user folder or use proper permissions|
| Timeout downloading packages | Slow or unstable internet connection | Retry installation with: pip install <package> --timeout 120 |
| Graph not displaying | Matplotlib backend issue | Add the following line at the end of your script: plt.show() |

✅ 5. Verification
To confirm all required packages are installed, run: `python3 -m pip list`

You should see:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
yfinance
Once confirmed, the project is ready for testing and analysis 🚀
